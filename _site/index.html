<h2 id="info-about-steam-deck">Info About Steam Deck</h2>

<h3 id="game-mode">Game Mode</h3>

<p>Game Mode is essentially an overlay running Big Picture Mode, allowing you to access the Quick Access Menu and the Steam Menu and control everything in one easy to use interface. This is the preferred method to play games as it allows you to set hardware limits, change settings on the fly, enable a fps counter, and many other things on the fly. This is what the Deck boots into by default.</p>

<h3 id="desktop-mode">Desktop Mode</h3>

<p>Desktop Mode is what Game Mode is installed over. It is the real computer behind everything. Built on Arch Linux with KDE Desktop Environment. It can be accessed through Game Mode by opening the Steam Menu and clicking <strong>Power &gt; Switch to Desktop</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="wine">Wine</h3>

<p>Wine (originally an acronym for “Wine Is Not an Emulator”) is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, &amp; BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.</p>

<p><em>from <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WineHQ</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To simplify: Wine Makes Linux run Windows apps</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="proton">Proton</h3>

<p>Proton is a compatibility layer for Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems. Proton is developed by Valve in cooperation with developers from CodeWeavers. It is a collection of software and libraries combined with a patched version of Wine to improve performance and compatibility with Windows games. Proton is designed for integration into the Steam client as “Steam Play”. It is officially distributed through the client, although third-party forks can be manually installed. Proton incorporates several libraries that improve 3D performance. These include Direct3D-to-Vulkan translation layers, namely DXVK for Direct3D 9, 10 and 11, and VKD3D-Proton for Direct3D 12.</p>

<p><em>from <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></em></p>

<p><strong><em>There are two different Proton iterations right now:</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="steams-official-proton">Steam’s Official Proton</h4>

<p>This is what comes baked into the system more or less. These are selectable by going into the game Properties and clicking the Compatibility tab. From there you’ll click the checkbox next to “Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool”. Here you will be able to select any Proton available through steam as well as any others you have installed. Sometimes different games work with different Proton versions. More often than not Proton Experimental is the most up to date and has the best compatibility rate. All games are different, some may not have working sound unless you go to an old version. Mess with this first if you have issues running games.</p>

<h4 id="ge-proton">GE-Proton</h4>

<p>GE Proton (or Glorious Eggroll Proton) is an open source variant of Steams Proton that is user developed and maintained. It usually has faster support for games and also includes additional features and fixes, some which Steam can’t include for licensing reasons. It’s usually installed through ProtonUpQt, and can be selected the same as any other Proton version once installed, in the compatibility section of any game’s properties.</p>

<h3 id="prefixes">Prefixes</h3>

<p>A (Wine/Proton) prefix is what makes Proton able to run a Windows app on Linux “natively”. Inside of any prefix you’ll usually find a series of folders and files, one being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drive_c</code>. The reason for all of this is the folder structure and other dependencies and files emulates a Windows environment. Essentially a prefix pretends to be a Windows hard drive, pretends Windows is installed on it, and translates Linux commands/operations into Windows specific versions. This combined with Wine/Proton are the most major components of playing a Windows game on a Linux device.</p>

<h3 id="launchers">Launchers</h3>

<p>Launchers are apps built for Linux that allow you to play games from other Launcher based game companies. Heroic, Bottles, and Lutris are the mainly discussed ones. These add a few more things some games may need to run efficiently or properly at all. While these are a preferred method for ease of use, keep in mind this is another layer between your game and SteamOS so at times troubleshooting it may be a little more difficult. These also usually come with Wine configuration, login support for launchers, the option to add shortcuts to Steam, and a whole slew of other features allowing you to do less tinkering and kind of just get going.</p>

<h3 id="decky-loader">Decky Loader</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!WARNING]
<strong>Decky Loader</strong> is a third-party plugin loader for the Steam Deck. It allows you to add custom features and tweaks to your Deck, but it has been known to break after SteamOS or plugin updates. <strong>Support for Decky Loader is not offered here. Use at your own risk.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="installing-decky-loader">Installing Decky Loader</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader">Decky Loader GitHub</a> and follow the installation instructions for your Steam Deck.</li>
  <li>After installation, Decky will appear as a plug icon in the Steam Deck’s quick access menu.</li>
  <li>You can browse and install plugins directly from the Decky interface.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="disabling-or-uninstalling-decky-loader">Disabling or Uninstalling Decky Loader</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Decky menu (plug icon).</li>
  <li>Use the settings or options menu to disable or uninstall Decky Loader or any installed plugins.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you experience issues with games or SteamOS after installing Decky Loader or plugins, try disabling or uninstalling Decky Loader first.</p>

You can install dependencies, set the prefix up to use DLL files (for mods), set the Windows versions compatibility, install game updates or other exe files, and so much more. This is like the control panel in Windows for each individual games prefix. This is also where you can find the <strong>compatdata</strong> folder number for any non steam games you have installed (if you installed through steam). The folder number will be in parentheses next to whatever the entry is titled in steam.</td>

For Windows there are two options, <span class="modern-link">Winpinator</span> and <span class="modern-link">Warpinator</span>. I have personally had more luck with the actual Warpinator.

<blockquote>
  <p>[!CAUTION]
<strong>Installer Warning:</strong> On Linux/Steam Deck, never install games or repacks to the <strong>C:</strong> drive (or any default path inside <code>drive_c</code>). The <strong>C:</strong> drive is actually a hidden folder inside a “prefix”—a fake Windows environment created by Proton or Wine. If you install to <strong>C:</strong>, your game will be buried deep inside the prefix and hard to find or move later.</p>

  <p>Instead, always choose a custom folder (like <strong>Games</strong> on your SD card, internal storage, or another drive). In most installers, your internal storage or microSD card will show up as a different drive letter—often <strong>Z:</strong>, <strong>D:</strong>, or something other than <strong>C:</strong>. Look for the folder you created (such as <strong>Games</strong>) in one of those drives and select it as your install location. After installation, double-check the folder you selected for your game files.</p>

    <li>Avoid installing to the C drive to prevent issues later on.</li>
    <li>Some games may have a different <code>.exe</code> file for launching. Use Dolphin File Explorer to search for other <code>.exe</code> files in the game folder.</li>
    <li>Some games require specific Proton versions. Search Reddit for recommendations, and use ProtonUp-QT to download other Proton versions if needed.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!CAUTION]
Make sure Lutris has access to the filesystem. This can be done through Flatseal.
If your Lutris games aren’t saving, this is probably why.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
It’s not necessary to install a game using Lutris as described here. But for some (cracked) games it works better or as described below is necessary insofar as you need a different runner for e. g. the installation of FitGirl repacks. So if you have an already installed game, skip steps 6 to 12.</p>

<h3 id="finding-non-steam-game-proton-folder">Finding Non-Steam Game Proton Folder</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
This only works for games added to steam already as a non steam game.
This means you need to enable proton on the game and try to run it once so it can set up a prefix for it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Open <strong>ProtonTricks</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the list of games find the title you gave your game in Steam itself.</li>
    <li>Next to the game name, there is a long number.</li>
    <li>Open <strong>Dolphin</strong>.</li>
    <li>Go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata</code> and find the number from earlier.</li>
    <li>Enter the folder, then enter the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pfx</code> folder.</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drive_c</code> is the folder a lot of the “wine” aspect of things will happen.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Sometimes games will use either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Program Files</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Program Files (x86)</code>. Check both.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!CAUTION]
In ProtonTricks, your game will show as whatever it is titled in Steam upon opening. If you never changed the name from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup.exe</code> then that’s what it will be named.</p>

  <p>If you selected <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:</code> during an install (which you shouldn’t have done!), your game may be installed in one of these folders.
If you’d love to find out why that isn’t a good idea, keep it installed there and see.</p>

<h3 id="installing-dependencies">Installing Dependencies</h3>
<h4 id="what-are-dependencies">What are dependencies?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Dependencies are other tools/apps that software relies on to work.
These are often included in the game installers on official releases. When you add a non-steam game from a pirated package, they may include these in a separate folder, or they may not be included at all. Without them the games that were designed around these dependencies at best will work with issues, and at worst won’t open at all. If you’re situation is either of these, this is the section that <em>should</em> help.</p>

  <p><strong>Dependencies are needed if:</strong></p>
  <ul class="task-list">
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Video/audio is messed up or not working.</li>
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Error at beginning stating a certain file or app cannot be found.</li>
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />The game doesn’t start.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="how-to-find-what-dependencies-are-needed-for-your-game">How to find what dependencies are needed for your game.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
In the event that a game does not come with it’s dependencies in the folder or you are not sure which they need, Steam actually has a database dedicated to every iteration of every game they have. Being the awesome company they are, they have a dedicated log of all things required through the history of a games life cycle on their server. This includes everything from prices up to dependencies, updates and DLC. In this instance, we’re going to show you where to go on their database to get the info you need.</p>
</blockquote>

<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#E3F2FD" width="100%" style="padding:15px; border-radius:5px;">
<strong>Steam Database</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Find your game on <a href="https://steamdb.info">SteamDB</a> by searching it by title.</li>
    <li>On the game's page, click the <strong>Depots</strong> section (in the same area as <strong>Prices</strong>, <strong>Packages</strong>, <strong>DLCs</strong>, etc.)</li>
    <li>Look for anything with a <strong>Windows</strong> logo next to it. Anything else is specific to the game and can be ignored.</li>
    <li>In this example, GTA V requires <code>VC 2012 Redist</code> and <code>DirectX Jun 2010 Redist</code>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Microsoft has everything you need.
Because Microsoft has been around for ages, and they have been the main OS for many business and personal users for decades, they have to keep quite the extensive catalog of legacy software on their website. This means all dependencies should be available right there on the website itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!CAUTION]
If it wasn’t explicitly clear in the previous note, do not download these from places other than the Microsoft site or Wine/ProtonTricks. While they may not mess your Steam Deck up due to it being Linux, it’s just good practice to not download official and freely available things that can harm your system from shady places or people. Repackers issue the same stuff and probably get them from Microsoft themselves. Just save yourself the trouble.</p>

<h3 id="adding-dlls-to-proton">Adding DLLs to Proton</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Windows uses something called Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).
These are used by applications/games to bind functions to each other and work with data inside of the folder they are made in. Linux does not use DLLs so it is sometimes required to point your Wine/Proton prefix to the ones games use. This especially applies when modding a game, as a lot of mods rely on DLLs. We will discuss here how to add them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
The Deck is an amazing emulator machine.
The sweet spot for performance is mostly in the Xbox/PS2 era, with the Switch being an exception for current gen. Anything before that should run flawlessly (on a per game basis). Do not expect to be emulating Xbox 360 (possible for some games) and definitely don’t even for a second <em>think about</em> running PS4/Xbox One or later. There is a lot of info out there regarding emulation on the deck. We are going to gather the most frequently asked questions here. Here’s a good <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1ea1675/emudeck_vs_retrodeck/">conversation</a> on the differences between the two.</p>

<p>EmuDeck is a collection of scripts that allows you to autoconfigure your Steam Deck, it creates your roms directory structure and downloads all of the needed Emulators for you along with the best configurations for each of them. EmuDeck works great with <a href="https://github.com/SteamGridDB/steam-rom-manager">Steam Rom Manager</a> or with <a href="https://es-de.org">EmulationStation DE</a>.</p>

<h3 id="individual-emulators">Individual emulators</h3>
<p>Individual emulators can be installed as well. A lot of them are already on the <strong>Discover Store</strong>. While this is a perfectly viable method of setting up your emulation zone, we will not really be covering it here. The reason for this is that we want you to have the most straightforward and easy setup you can get. Also, quite frankly, if a lot of people follow the guides posted above and use the already-developed frontends we suggest, we get less questions and have an easier time supporting people. Should you choose to do things this way, you will manually have to set every emulator up, tweak them all to look right, organize the folder structure, and download so much extra stuff. By the time you’re halfway done, you’ll wonder why you didn’t do RetroDeck/EmuDeck in the beginning.</p>

<h3 id="switch-emulation">Switch Emulation</h3>

<h4 id="recommended-emulators">Recommended Emulators</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
As of 2024, the two main Switch emulators were taken down by the most ruthlessly litigious playing card game companies of all time. Taken down does not mean gone, though. Nothing is ever fully erased from the internet. <strong>EVER</strong>. With that being said, we are not going to risk having this guide taken down by linking but as of now the best and most reliable iterations are to find mirrors of <strong>Yuzu</strong> or <strong>Ryujinx</strong>. Those will have been last updated before the shutdowns. As of the time this guide was written that should not affect any of the current games that are out (at least the important ones). There is a fork of <strong>Ryujinx</strong> that is being maintained by <em>GreemDev</em>. The <strong>Yuzu</strong> forks are <strong>Sudachi</strong> or <strong>Suyu</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!CAUTION]
All Switch emulators require prod.keys and firmware.
We will not tell you where to find those.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="switch-emulator-performance">Switch Emulator Performance</h4>
<p>Some games will run perfectly fine on the Deck. Some will have occasional frame dips. Some will have bad audio. Some just won’t work at all. This is the nature of emulation. The more popular games will have patches available for them. Someone has amazingly made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AhKo6rjQHXLuZEHPozA-F-YPejLPBrj0jbPNUyNDx78/edit?gid=77197668#gid=77197668">compatibility list</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bios-roms-and-other-files">BIOS, ROMs, and other files</h3>
<p>Some emulators will require BIOS files to operate. These are usually found in a multitude of places. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmulationStranger/comments/11j09qc/idiots_guide_to_emudeck_where_to_find_bios_and/">reddit post</a> should have you on the way to finding the right BIOS and ROMs for each emulator. Specifically the ROM Megathread. Again we will not link here for safety reasons.</p>

<h3 id="pc-ports">PC Ports</h3>
<p>Some of the games you want to emulate may have PC ports. Always check to see what came out for PC and if it ran better that way. For example, Scarface has way better QoL mods and patches that make it a much better experience on the deck. The real benefit of these is that you can modify the games to run better, and also there is more documentation and development for them as the files are more accessible to those modding. The biggest benefit of emulation is in most cases. you will save battery. PC ports usually have FPS mods, widescreen fixes, and a slew of other enhancements that make it a better experience overall. There are even PC ports for old N64 games like Mario 64, Perfect Dark, and so on. We highly recommend looking into these options. When you do find a PC port, be sure to go to <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home">PCGamingWiki</a> to see what all should be added to the games to make them perform at their best.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cracksdlcupdates">Cracks/DLC/Updates</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Since a lot of cracks and updates are made for PC, it is often recommended to do whatever patching of files is required on your PC, then to transfer the fully patched game over to your Deck. This certainly applies in situations with CreamAPI, Goldberg Steam Emulator, and any cracked game updates. If you don’t have the means to do that, or you like to do things in hard mode, then here is how you’d do that.</p>

  <p>This is not a blanket guide for all situations. This is just for the most common situations. Further tweaking may be needed depending on the game, the patch, or a plethora of other reasons.
Make sure ProtonTricks has access to your drives and SD card through Flatseal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
A lot of games come in what are called <em>compressed</em> formats. These are used when a folder or file is too large and you want to shrink them down. Repackers and download sites do this so they can be downloaded faster. Sometimes they come with the file extensions listed above in parentheses, or they may come in something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.001, .002</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7z01, .7z02,</code>, etc. These can be handled using <strong>PeaZip</strong></p>

  <p>[!NOTE]
This will result in double the size of your download or more taking up space on your drive.
If there were no errors in the extraction or the installation, you can delete the compressed files. If it was an installer, you may have triple the space taken up, once you are sure the game runs, delete the compressed files and the installer. Be sure to Empty your trash if you use that method.</p>

<h3 id="iso-files">ISO Files</h3>

  <p>[!NOTE]
Some games (even after you extract them) will be in <em>ISO</em> format.
These are digital disc images. In Windows, opening this would be the same thing as inserting a disc for your game to install from, except it’s all digital. These will have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.iso</code> extension, and will usually be rather large in size.</p>

<h3 id="install-locations">Install Locations</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
When installing games on PC, common practice is for it to install to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:</code> drive.
This is put in place because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:</code> drive is usually the main drive that Windows lives and operates through. Since we are emulating the PC, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:</code> drive isn’t really a drive at all. It’s a folder inside of a prefix usually named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drive_c</code>. The nature of prefix is to emulate a Windows environment with the bare minimum. So when you work within this environment, it is limited. It is always recommended to install in a folder outside of the prefix that you can get a hold of easily.</p>

  <p>The drive letters are named arbitrarily on a per-game installer basis.
Sometimes your memory card or hard drive may be under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D:</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F:</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Z:</code> seems to, more often than not, point to the root of SteamOS. This means you can always find both your connected drive and your main folder under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Z:\run\media\</code></p>

  <p>Your SD card will usually be named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mmcblk0p1</code>.</p>

    <li>Disable Decky and test your game</li>
    <li>Uninstall your plugins one by one, and see what changes it.</li>
    <li>Uninstall them all, and add them back one by one until you see the error happen again.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="is-proton-enabled">Is Proton Enabled?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]</p>

  <p>In some instances Steam may silently disable your forced Proton version for a non‑Steam shortcut.
Before doing anything else: open the shortcut’s Properties and re‑enable a Proton version (start with Proton Experimental).</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="are-there-quotes-around-the-target-path">Are there quotes around the target path?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]</p>

  <p>Paths containing spaces must be wrapped in quotes in Launch Options / Target field.
Example (GOOD): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"/home/deck/Games/Tomb Raider/game.exe"</code>
Example (BAD): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/deck/Games/Tomb Raider/game.exe</code></p>

<h4 id="are-dependencies-installed">Are dependencies installed?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!CAUTION]</p>

  <p>Missing DirectX / VC++ / .NET components will cause silent exits. See the <a href="#installing-dependencies">Installing Dependencies</a> section above and install what your game needs.</p>

<h3 id="mods-wont-load">Mods won’t load</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!WARNING]</p>

  <p>Possible causes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Required DLL overrides not applied (see <a href="#adding-dlls-to-proton">Adding DLLs to Proton</a>).</li>
    <li>Using a Windows-only mod manager when a native / alternative method exists.</li>
    <li>Mod loader files placed in wrong prefix path.</li>
    <li>Incompatible Proton version (test Proton-GE or older Proton).</li>
    <li>Incorrect case-sensitive filenames on Linux.</li>
  </ul>

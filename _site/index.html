      <article id="main-content" class="doc markdown-body"><h1 id="steam-deck-pirates-cove"><span class="hero-title">Steam Deck Pirates‚Äô Cove</span></h1>

<p class="hero-sub">A consolidated single-page reference for running Windows games, emulation, and tweaks on Steam Deck.</p>

<h2 id="info-about-steam-deck">Info About Steam Deck</h2>

<h3 id="game-mode">Game Mode</h3>
<p>Game Mode is essentially an overlay running Big Picture Mode, allowing you to access the Quick Access Menu and the Steam Menu and control everything in one easy to use interface. This is the preferred method to play games as it allows you to set hardware limits, change settings on the fly, enable a fps counter, and many other things on the fly. This is what the Deck boots into by default.</p>

<h3 id="desktop-mode">Desktop Mode</h3>
<p>Desktop Mode is what Game Mode is installed over. It is the real computer behind everything. Built on Arch Linux with KDE Desktop Environment. It can be accessed through Game Mode by opening the Steam Menu and clicking <strong>Power &gt; Switch to Desktop</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="wine">Wine</h3>
<p>Wine (originally an acronym for ‚ÄúWine Is Not an Emulator‚Äù) is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, &amp; BSD. Instead of simulating internal Windows logic like a virtual machine or emulator, Wine translates Windows API calls into POSIX calls on-the-fly, eliminating the performance and memory penalties of other methods and allowing you to cleanly integrate Windows applications into your desktop.</p>

<p><em>from <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WineHQ</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To simplify: Wine Makes Linux run Windows apps</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="proton">Proton</h3>
<p>Proton is a compatibility layer for Windows games to run on Linux-based operating systems. Proton is developed by Valve in cooperation with developers from CodeWeavers. It is a collection of software and libraries combined with a patched version of Wine to improve performance and compatibility with Windows games. Proton is designed for integration into the Steam client as ‚ÄúSteam Play‚Äù. It is officially distributed through the client, although third-party forks can be manually installed. Proton incorporates several libraries that improve 3D performance. These include Direct3D-to-Vulkan translation layers, namely DXVK for Direct3D 9, 10 and 11, and VKD3D-Proton for Direct3D 12.</p>

<p><em>from <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></em></p>

<p><strong><em>There are two different Proton iterations right now:</em></strong></p>

<h4 id="steams-official-proton">Steam‚Äôs Official Proton</h4>
<p>This is what comes baked into the system more or less. These are selectable by going into the game Properties and clicking the Compatibility tab. From there you‚Äôll click the checkbox next to ‚ÄúForce the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool‚Äù. Here you will be able to select any Proton available through steam as well as any others you have installed. Sometimes different games work with different Proton versions. More often than not Proton Experimental is the most up to date and has the best compatibility rate. All games are different, some may not have working sound unless you go to an old version. Mess with this first if you have issues running games.</p>

<h4 id="ge-proton">GE-Proton</h4>
<p>GE Proton (or Glorious Eggroll Proton) is an open source variant of Steams Proton that is user developed and maintained. It usually has faster support for games and also includes additional features and fixes, some which Steam can‚Äôt include for licensing reasons. It‚Äôs usually installed through ProtonUpQt, and can be selected the same as any other Proton version once installed, in the compatibility section of any game‚Äôs properties.</p>

<h3 id="prefixes">Prefixes</h3>
<p>A (Wine/Proton) prefix is what makes Proton able to run a Windows app on Linux ‚Äúnatively‚Äù. Inside of any prefix you‚Äôll usually find a series of folders and files, one being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drive_c</code>. The reason for all of this is the folder structure and other dependencies and files emulates a Windows environment. Essentially a prefix pretends to be a Windows hard drive, pretends Windows is installed on it, and translates Linux commands/operations into Windows specific versions. This combined with Wine/Proton are the most major components of playing a Windows game on a Linux device.</p>

<h3 id="launchers">Launchers</h3>
<p>Launchers are apps built for Linux that allow you to play games from other Launcher based game companies. Heroic, Bottles, and Lutris are the mainly discussed ones. These add a few more things some games may need to run efficiently or properly at all. While these are a preferred method for ease of use, keep in mind this is another layer between your game and SteamOS so at times troubleshooting it may be a little more difficult. These also usually come with Wine configuration, login support for launchers, the option to add shortcuts to Steam, and a whole slew of other features allowing you to do less tinkering and kind of just get going.</p>

      <td style="text-align: center">Similar to WineTricks, this allows you to manipulate the prefixes for your individual Windows based games. You can install dependencies, set the prefix up to use DLL files (for mods), set the Windows versions compatibility, install game updates or other exe files, and so much more. This is like the control panel in Windows for each individual games prefix. This is also where you can find the <strong>compatdata</strong> folder number for any non steam games you have installed (if you installed through steam). The folder number will be in parentheses next to whatever the entry is titled in steam.</td>

      <td style="text-align: center">If it isn‚Äôt obvious from the name, these are the most commonly recommended methods of playing emulators and retro games. The advantages of these methods rather than setting up every emulator individually are: better folder structure, custom settings tailored to the Deck itself, a frontend that brings everything into view easily, and a bunch of other included tools that make getting on the road to emulation a lot easier. There is a larger section about emulation below.</td>

      <td style="text-align: center">Warpinator is a recommended file transfer service for your local network. This application works with all OS options. It will need to be running on both your Steam Deck and the device you are transferring files from/to. For Windows there are two options, <a href="https://winpinator.swisz.cz/">Winpinator</a> and <a href="https://warpinator.com/warpinator-download/">Warpinator</a>. I have personally had more luck with the actual Warpinator. Sometimes if there are connection issues it is best to manually set the network device in settings.

This is great in the absence of a keyboard and mouse, you can also send files to yourself (albeit small ones). This is really useful also if you don‚Äôt wanna keep switching between monitor inputs while docked, etc. If you want real ease of use be sure to set up unattended access with a password for the remote app so you don‚Äôt have to use the Deck to accept every session.</td>

<strong>Method 2: Using Steam Compatibility Tool</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Once the installation is complete, go back to Steam and remove <code>setup.exe</code> (right-click &gt; Manage &gt; Remove non-Steam game).</li>
    <li>Go to the installation folder, find the <code>game.exe</code> file, right-click on it, and add it to Steam.</li>

  <p>[!NOTE]
If it shows an error or doesn‚Äôt run: Either the Proton version is incorrect (try different ones) or there‚Äôs a missing dependency. If it‚Äôs the latter, refer to a dependencies guide (<a href="#installing-dependencies">Dependencies Guide</a>).</p>

<strong>Additional Notes</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Some downloads may come in <code>.rar</code> files. Extract these using an app like PeaZip before proceeding to Step 2.</li>
    <li>Proton Experimental should usually work, but if it doesn‚Äôt, try the latest Proton version or Proton-GE.</li>
    <li>You may need to enable hidden files for this step.</li>
    <li>To install on a microSD card, create a folder named <code>Games</code> on the SD card root. Then, add the following to <code>setup.exe</code>‚Äôs launch options:
        <pre><code>STEAM_COMPAT_MOUNTS="/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Games/" %command%</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Avoid installing to the C drive to prevent issues later on.</li>
    <li>Some games may have a different <code>.exe</code> file for launching. Use Dolphin File Explorer to search for other <code>.exe</code> files in the game folder.</li>
    <li>Some games require specific Proton versions. Search Reddit for recommendations, and use ProtonUp-QT to download other Proton versions if needed.</li>
    <li>This guide should help you install and configure non-Steam games on your Steam Deck. Enjoy gaming!</li>

In ProtonTricks, your game will show as whatever it is titled in Steam upon opening. If you never changed the name from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup.exe</code> then that‚Äôs what it will be named.</p>

  <p>If you selected <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:</code> during an install (which you shouldn‚Äôt have done!), your game may be installed in one of these folders.

<h3 id="installing-dependencies">Installing Dependencies</h3>
<h4 id="what-are-dependencies">What are dependencies?</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Dependencies are other tools/apps that software relies on to work.
These are often included in the game installers on official releases. When you add a non-steam game from a pirated package, they may include these in a separate folder, or they may not be included at all. Without them the games that were designed around these dependencies at best will work with issues, and at worst won‚Äôt open at all. If you‚Äôre situation is either of these, this is the section that <em>should</em> help.</p>

  <p><strong>Dependencies are needed if:</strong></p>
  <ul class="task-list">
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Video/audio is messed up or not working.</li>
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Error at beginning stating a certain file or app cannot be found.</li>
    <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />The game doesn‚Äôt start.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="how-to-find-what-dependencies-are-needed-for-your-game">How to find what dependencies are needed for your game.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
In the event that a game does not come with it‚Äôs dependencies in the folder or you are not sure which they need, Steam actually has a database dedicated to every iteration of every game they have. Being the awesome company they are, they have a dedicated log of all things required through the history of a games life cycle on their server. This includes everything from prices up to dependencies, updates and DLC. In this instance, we‚Äôre going to show you where to go on their database to get the info you need.</p>

<strong>Steam Database</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Find your game on <a href="https://steamdb.info">SteamDB</a> by searching it by title.</li>
    <li>On the game's page, click the <strong>Depots</strong> section (in the same area as <strong>Prices</strong>, <strong>Packages</strong>, <strong>DLCs</strong>, etc.)</li>
    <li>Look for anything with a <strong>Windows</strong> logo next to it. Anything else is specific to the game and can be ignored.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Microsoft has everything you need.
Because Microsoft has been around for ages, and they have been the main OS for many business and personal users for decades, they have to keep quite the extensive catalog of legacy software on their website. This means all dependencies should be available right there on the website itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!CAUTION]
If it wasn‚Äôt explicitly clear in the previous note, do not download these from places other than the Microsoft site or Wine/ProtonTricks. While they may not mess your Steam Deck up due to it being Linux, it‚Äôs just good practice to not download official and freely available things that can harm your system from shady places or people. Repackers issue the same stuff and probably get them from Microsoft themselves. Just save yourself the trouble.</p>

  <p>[!NOTE]
Windows uses something called Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).
These are used by applications/games to bind functions to each other and work with data inside of the folder they are made in. Linux does not use DLLs so it is sometimes required to point your Wine/Proton prefix to the ones games use. This especially applies when modding a game, as a lot of mods rely on DLLs. We will discuss here how to add them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
The Deck is an amazing emulator machine.
The sweet spot for performance is mostly in the Xbox/PS2 era, with the Switch being an exception for current gen. Anything before that should run flawlessly (on a per game basis). Do not expect to be emulating Xbox 360 (possible for some games) and definitely don‚Äôt even for a second <em>think about</em> running PS4/Xbox One or later. There is a lot of info out there regarding emulation on the deck. We are going to gather the most frequently asked questions here. Here‚Äôs a good <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1ea1675/emudeck_vs_retrodeck/">conversation</a> on the differences between the two.</p>

<h3 id="individual-emulators">Individual emulators</h3>
<p>Individual emulators can be installed as well. A lot of them are already on the <strong>Discover Store</strong>. While this is a perfectly viable method of setting up your emulation zone, we will not really be covering it here. The reason for this is that we want you to have the most straightforward and easy setup you can get. Also, quite frankly, if a lot of people follow the guides posted above and use the already-developed frontends we suggest, we get less questions and have an easier time supporting people. Should you choose to do things this way, you will manually have to set every emulator up, tweak them all to look right, organize the folder structure, and download so much extra stuff. By the time you‚Äôre halfway done, you‚Äôll wonder why you didn‚Äôt do RetroDeck/EmuDeck in the beginning.</p>

<h3 id="switch-emulation">Switch Emulation</h3>

<h4 id="recommended-emulators">Recommended Emulators</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
As of 2024, the two main Switch emulators were taken down by the most ruthlessly litigious playing card game companies of all time. Taken down does not mean gone, though. Nothing is ever fully erased from the internet. <strong>EVER</strong>. With that being said, we are not going to risk having this guide taken down by linking but as of now the best and most reliable iterations are to find mirrors of <strong>Yuzu</strong> or <strong>Ryujinx</strong>. Those will have been last updated before the shutdowns. As of the time this guide was written that should not affect any of the current games that are out (at least the important ones). There is a fork of <strong>Ryujinx</strong> that is being maintained by <em>GreemDev</em>. The <strong>Yuzu</strong> forks are <strong>Sudachi</strong> or <strong>Suyu</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!CAUTION]
All Switch emulators require prod.keys and firmware.
We will not tell you where to find those.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="switch-emulator-performance">Switch Emulator Performance</h4>
<p>Some games will run perfectly fine on the Deck. Some will have occasional frame dips. Some will have bad audio. Some just won‚Äôt work at all. This is the nature of emulation. The more popular games will have patches available for them. Someone has amazingly made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AhKo6rjQHXLuZEHPozA-F-YPejLPBrj0jbPNUyNDx78/edit?gid=77197668#gid=77197668">compatibility list</a>.</p>

<h3 id="bios-roms-and-other-files">BIOS, ROMs, and other files</h3>
<p>Some emulators will require BIOS files to operate. These are usually found in a multitude of places. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmulationStranger/comments/11j09qc/idiots_guide_to_emudeck_where_to_find_bios_and/">reddit post</a> should have you on the way to finding the right BIOS and ROMs for each emulator. Specifically the ROM Megathread. Again we will not link here for safety reasons.</p>

<h3 id="pc-ports">PC Ports</h3>
<p>Some of the games you want to emulate may have PC ports. Always check to see what came out for PC and if it ran better that way. For example, Scarface has way better QoL mods and patches that make it a much better experience on the deck. The real benefit of these is that you can modify the games to run better, and also there is more documentation and development for them as the files are more accessible to those modding. The biggest benefit of emulation is in most cases. you will save battery. PC ports usually have FPS mods, widescreen fixes, and a slew of other enhancements that make it a better experience overall. There are even PC ports for old N64 games like Mario 64, Perfect Dark, and so on. We highly recommend looking into these options. When you do find a PC port, be sure to go to <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home">PCGamingWiki</a> to see what all should be added to the games to make them perform at their best.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cracksdlcupdates">Cracks/DLC/Updates</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Since a lot of cracks and updates are made for PC, it is often recommended to do whatever patching of files is required on your PC, then to transfer the fully patched game over to your Deck. This certainly applies in situations with CreamAPI, Goldberg Steam Emulator, and any cracked game updates. If you don‚Äôt have the means to do that, or you like to do things in hard mode, then here is how you‚Äôd do that.</p>

  <p>This is not a blanket guide for all situations. This is just for the most common situations. Further tweaking may be needed depending on the game, the patch, or a plethora of other reasons.
Make sure ProtonTricks has access to your drives and SD card through Flatseal.</p>

  <p>[!NOTE]
A lot of games come in what are called <em>compressed</em> formats. These are used when a folder or file is too large and you want to shrink them down. Repackers and download sites do this so they can be downloaded faster. Sometimes they come with the file extensions listed above in parentheses, or they may come in something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.001, .002</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7z01, .7z02,</code>, etc. These can be handled using <strong>PeaZip</strong></p>

<h3 id="install-locations">Install Locations</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
When installing games on PC, common practice is for it to install to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:</code> drive.
This is put in place because the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:</code> drive is usually the main drive that Windows lives and operates through. Since we are emulating the PC, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C:</code> drive isn‚Äôt really a drive at all. It‚Äôs a folder inside of a prefix usually named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drive_c</code>. The nature of prefix is to emulate a Windows environment with the bare minimum. So when you work within this environment, it is limited. It is always recommended to install in a folder outside of the prefix that you can get a hold of easily.</p>

  <p>The drive letters are named arbitrarily on a per-game installer basis.
Sometimes your memory card or hard drive may be under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D:</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F:</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Z:</code> seems to, more often than not, point to the root of SteamOS. This means you can always find both your connected drive and your main folder under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Z:\run\media\</code></p>

  <p>Your SD card will usually be named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mmcblk0p1</code>.</p>

There is also a cool app that is recommended called <strong><a href="https://github.com/Jannomag/shortix">Shortix</a></strong>.
Shortix creates user readable symlinks for Proton game prefixes. Once it is installed, you will have a folder created that provides shortcuts to your proton folders. All of the info is in that link and should kind of make things a little easier in the process of finding your mods, game saves, etc. If you‚Äôd like a manual method to find the folders, I have written a guide below.</p>

<h3 id="controller-not-working">Controller not working</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>[!WARNING]
Some games will load perfectly but won‚Äôt have controller input. Prime examples are the new Spider Man games and Ghost of Tsushima. There are a few ways to solve this. Covered below:</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="steam-input">Steam Input</h4>
<p>In most cases you can disable Steam Input in the Game Menu and that alone should solve the issue.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#E3F2FD" width="100%" style="padding:15px; border-radius:5px;">
<strong>In Desktop Mode:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Select your game in Steam</li>
    <li>Click on the gear icon to the right of the <strong>Play</strong> button</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Properties</strong></li>
    <li>Select the <strong>Controller</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Next to <code>Override for [Game Name]</code> click the dropdown</li>
    <li>Select <code>Disable Steam Input</code></li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4 id="finding-community-layouts">Finding Community Layouts</h4>
<p>There are also <strong>Community Layouts</strong>. These are layouts made by (you guessed it) the community on steam. These are searched through steam based on what they are named in the Steam Interface. Sometimes this yields results, but often for me it hasn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>A couple of people have reported being able to pinpoint the search by changing the shortcut name to the Steam URL listing number:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#E3F2FD" width="100%" style="padding:15px; border-radius:5px;">
<strong>In Desktop mode:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Open <a href="https://steamdb.info">SteamDB</a></li>
    <li>Search for your game and click on it's listing.</li>
    <li>The number you're looking for will be either in the url after <code>/app/</code> or next to <strong>App ID</strong> in on the actual page.</li>
    <li>Copy the number (no special characters).</li>
    <li>Go to your game listing in the Steam app.</li>
    <li>Click the gear to the right of the <strong>Play</strong> button.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
    <li>Change the title to the number you copied</li>
    <li>Close the settings</li>
    <li>Click on the Controller Icon next to the Gear Icon, click on the Layout Selector (above <strong>View Layout</strong> and <strong>Edit Layout</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3 id="game-opens-steam">Game opens steam</h3>
<p>Either your crack isnt applied properly or you need to change the number in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">steamapp_id.txt</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> in the game folder.</p>

<h3 id="no-licenses">No licenses</h3>
<p>If this shows it means your crack isn‚Äôt working. Make sure you copied the files over properly, and that you have pointed to all of the relevent DLLs and dependencies.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#E3F2FD" width="100%" style="padding:15px; border-radius:5px;">
<p>More often than not, this is related to a plugin running in Decky. To verify this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Disable Decky and test your game</li>
    <li>Uninstall your plugins one by one, and see what changes it.</li>
    <li>Uninstall them all, and add them back one by one until you see the error happen again.</li>

<h4 id="is-proton-enabled">Is Proton Enabled?</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>[!NOTE]
Steam may silently disable your forced Proton version for a non‚ÄëSteam shortcut. Re‚Äëopen Properties ‚Üí Compatibility and re‚Äëselect Proton (start with Proton Experimental) before deeper troubleshooting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="are-there-quotes-around-the-target-path">Are there quotes around the target path?</h4>

  <p>[!NOTE]
File paths with spaces must be quoted.<br />
Example (GOOD): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"/home/deck/Games/Tomb Raider/game.exe"</code><br />
Example (BAD): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/home/deck/Games/Tomb Raider/game.exe</code></p>

<h4 id="are-dependencies-installed">Are dependencies installed?</h4>

  <p>[!CAUTION]
Missing DirectX / VC++ / .NET components cause silent exits. See <a href="#installing-dependencies">Installing Dependencies</a> and add what the game needs.</p>

<h3 id="mods-wont-load">Mods won‚Äôt load</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>[!WARNING]
Possible causes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing DLL overrides (see <a href="#adding-dlls-to-proton">Adding DLLs to Proton</a>).</li>
    <li>Windows‚Äëonly mod manager used; prefer native / alternative method.</li>
    <li>Mod loader files in wrong prefix/game folder.</li>
    <li>Incompatible Proton version (test Proton‚ÄëGE / older stable).</li>

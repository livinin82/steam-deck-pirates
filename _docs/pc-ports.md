## PC Ports
Some of the games you want to emulate may have PC ports. Always check to see what came out for PC and if it ran better that way. For example, Scarface has way better QoL mods and patches that make it a much better experience on the deck. The real benefit of these is that you can modify the games to run better, and also there is more documentation and development for them as the files are more accessible to those modding. The biggest benefit of emulation is in most cases. you will save battery. PC ports usually have FPS mods, widescreen fixes, and a slew of other enhancements that make it a better experience overall. There are even PC ports for old N64 games like Mario 64, Perfect Dark, and so on. We highly recommend looking into these options. When you do find a PC port, be sure to go to [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home) to see what all should be added to the games to make them perform at their best.

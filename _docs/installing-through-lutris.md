## Installing games through Lutris

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure Lutris has access to the filesystem. This can be done through Flatseal.
> If your Lutris games aren't saving, this is probably why.

> [!NOTE]
> It's not necessary to install a game using Lutris as described here. But for some (cracked) games it works better or as described below is necessary insofar as you need a different runner for e. g. the installation of FitGirl repacks. So if you have an already installed game, skip steps 6 to 12.

<div class="panel">
<ol>
    <li>Obtain your desired game from a respected source.</li>
    <li>Install Lutris and open it.</li>
    <li>Click on to top left "+"-button to add a game.</li>
    <li>Enter the name of the game and select the Runner "Wine".</li>
    <li>Change to the tab "Game options".</li>
    <li>Click on the top right button "Browse.." to select the game's executable.</li>
    <li>Browse to the directory of your downloaded game and select the installer's <code>*.exe</code>.</li>
    <li>Click "Save", you'll see your game's installation has been added to Lutris.</li>
    <li>Double-click on it or use the bottom-left button "Play".</li>
    <li>The installation should start, follow the on-screen instructions.</li>
    <li>After the installation is done, right-click the game in Lutris and click "Configure".</li>
    <li>Go to "Game options" and click the top right button "Browse..".</li>
    <li>Browse to the directory in which you've installed the game.</li>
    <li>Select the game's executable and click the bottom right "Save".</li>
    <li>Double-click the game in Lutris to start it or use the bottom left button "Play".</li>
</ol>
</div>

> [!NOTE]
> If a game doesn't work or has poor performance, click "Configure" on the game and tick the bottom left box "Show advanced options". Now you can edit the game's options, change the runner, etc.

## Install Locations
> [!NOTE]
> When installing games on PC, common practice is for it to install to the `C:` drive.
> This is put in place because the `C:` drive is usually the main drive that Windows lives and operates through. Since we are emulating the PC, the `C:` drive isn't really a drive at all. It's a folder inside of a prefix usually named `drive_c`. The nature of prefix is to emulate a Windows environment with the bare minimum. So when you work within this environment, it is limited. It is always recommended to install in a folder outside of the prefix that you can get a hold of easily.
>
> The drive letters are named arbitrarily on a per-game installer basis.
> Sometimes your memory card or hard drive may be under `D:` or `F:`. `Z:` seems to, more often than not, point to the root of SteamOS. This means you can always find both your connected drive and your main folder under `Z:\run\media\`
>
> Your SD card will usually be named `mmcblk0p1`.

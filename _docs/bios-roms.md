## BIOS, ROMs, and other files
Some emulators will require BIOS files to operate. These are usually found in a multitude of places. This [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/user/EmulationStranger/comments/11j09qc/idiots_guide_to_emudeck_where_to_find_bios_and/) should have you on the way to finding the right BIOS and ROMs for each emulator. Specifically the ROM Megathread. Again we will not link here for safety reasons.

## Controller not working

> [!WARNING]
> Some games will load perfectly but won't have controller input. Prime examples are the new Spider Man games and Ghost of Tsushima. There are a few ways to solve this. Covered below:

#### Steam Input
In most cases you can disable Steam Input in the Game Menu and that alone should solve the issue.

<div class="panel">
<strong>In Desktop Mode:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Select your game in Steam</li>
    <li>Click on the gear icon to the right of the <strong>Play</strong> button</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Properties</strong></li>
    <li>Select the <strong>Controller</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Next to <code>Override for [Game Name]</code> click the dropdown</li>
    <li>Select <code>Disable Steam Input</code></li>
</ul>
</div>

#### Finding Community Layouts
There are also **Community Layouts**. These are layouts made by (you guessed it) the community on steam. These are searched through steam based on what they are named in the Steam Interface. Sometimes this yields results, but often for me it hasn't.

A couple of people have reported being able to pinpoint the search by changing the shortcut name to the Steam URL listing number:

<div class="panel">
<strong>In Desktop mode:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Open <a href="https://steamdb.info">SteamDB</a></li>
    <li>Search for your game and click on it's listing.</li>
    <li>The number you're looking for will be either in the url after <code>/app/</code> or next to <strong>App ID</strong> in on the actual page.</li>
    <li>Copy the number (no special characters).</li>
    <li>Go to your game listing in the Steam app.</li>
    <li>Click the gear to the right of the <strong>Play</strong> button.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
    <li>Change the title to the number you copied</li>
    <li>Close the settings</li>
    <li>Click on the Controller Icon next to the Gear Icon, click on the Layout Selector (above <strong>View Layout</strong> and <strong>Edit Layout</strong>)</li>
</ul>
</div>

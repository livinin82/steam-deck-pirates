## Compressed files (.rar, .zip, .7z, etc.)

> [!NOTE]
> A lot of games come in what are called *compressed* formats. These are used when a folder or file is too large and you want to shrink them down. Repackers and download sites do this so they can be downloaded faster. Sometimes they come with the file extensions listed above in parentheses, or they may come in something like `.001, .002` or `7z01, .7z02,`, etc. These can be handled using **PeaZip**

<div class="panel">
<ol>
    <li>Install <strong>PeaZip</strong> from the <strong>Discover Store</strong></li>
    <li>Open <strong>PeaZip</strong></li>
    <li>Click <em>File</em> then click <em>Open</em></li>
    <li>Find and open your compresed files. If there are multiple select all or select the one that ends in <code>.7z</code> <code>.zip</code> or <code>.rar</code>.</li>
    <li>Click <em>Extract</em></li>
    <li>Extract them to the same folder or another easy to find folder.</li>
    <li>This will either extract as an installer, or as a complete game. From there you can follow any of our guides above.</li>
</ol>
</div>

> [!NOTE]
> This will result in double the size of your download or more taking up space on your drive.
> If there were no errors in the extraction or the installation, you can delete the compressed files. If it was an installer, you may have triple the space taken up, once you are sure the game runs, delete the compressed files and the installer. Be sure to Empty your trash if you use that method.

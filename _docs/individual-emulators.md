## Individual emulators
Individual emulators can be installed as well. A lot of them are already on the **Discover Store**. While this is a perfectly viable method of setting up your emulation zone, we will not really be covering it here. The reason for this is that we want you to have the most straightforward and easy setup you can get. Also, quite frankly, if a lot of people follow the guides posted above and use the already-developed frontends we suggest, we get less questions and have an easier time supporting people. Should you choose to do things this way, you will manually have to set every emulator up, tweak them all to look right, organize the folder structure, and download so much extra stuff. By the time you're halfway done, you'll wonder why you didn't do RetroDeck/EmuDeck in the beginning.

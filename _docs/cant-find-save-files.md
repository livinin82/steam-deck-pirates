## Can't find save files.

> [!NOTE]
> There is also a cool app that is recommended called **[Shortix](https://github.com/Jannomag/shortix)**.
> Shortix creates user readable symlinks for Proton game prefixes. Once it is installed, you will have a folder created that provides shortcuts to your proton folders. All of the info is in that link and should kind of make things a little easier in the process of finding your mods, game saves, etc. If you'd like a manual method to find the folders, I have written a guide below.

<table>
<tr>
<div class="panel">
<ul>
    <li>Use the website <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home">PCGamingWiki</a> to find the save path location.</li>
    <li>Refer to our <a href="#finding-non-steam-game-proton-folder">Finding Non-Steam Game Proton Folder</a> section.</li>
    <li>Use the path on the website to navigate within <code>drive_c</code> and find your save file.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</tr>
</table>

> [!NOTE]
> If there is no save file, check the **Install Locations** section above.

# Apps you NEED TO have installed

> [!NOTE]
> Items in *Italics* are available on the Discover Store.

| Name/Link | Description |
| :--- | :---: |
| *[ProtonUpQt](https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/)* | This allows you to install unofficial Proton versions for Steam, Lutris, and other specialty situations. Highly recommended whether you're sailing the seas or not. |
| *[Flatseal](https://github.com/tchx84/Flatseal)* | Use this app to give extra permission to Flatpak apps. Flatpak is the method of installation used when you download apps in Discover. Most often in this scenario you would use this to allow an app to see all of the filesystem (if your other drives or folders aren't showing in an app like Lutris, this is how you would make it available). |
| *[ProtonTricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks)* | Similar to WineTricks, this allows you to manipulate the prefixes for your individual Windows based games. You can install dependencies, set the prefix up to use DLL files (for mods), set the Windows versions compatibility, install game updates or other exe files, and so much more. This is like the control panel in Windows for each individual games prefix. This is also where you can find the **compatdata** folder number for any non steam games you have installed (if you installed through steam). The folder number will be in parentheses next to whatever the entry is titled in steam. |
| *[Bottles](https://usebottles.com)/[Lutris](https://lutris.net)/[Heroic Launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com)* | These are the launchers that are mentioned in the previous section. Bottles, Lutris, and Heroic have varied access to the stupid launchers all AAA publishers insist on using. Thing of these as mega launcher that allows you to organize and work with a multitude of launcher-based games without having to jump from launcher to launcher. These can all be found on the discover store. |
| [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com)/[RetroDeck](https://retrodeck.net) | If it isn't obvious from the name, these are the most commonly recommended methods of playing emulators and retro games. The advantages of these methods rather than setting up every emulator individually are: better folder structure, custom settings tailored to the Deck itself, a frontend that brings everything into view easily, and a bunch of other included tools that make getting on the road to emulation a lot easier. There is a larger section about emulation below. |
| *[Warpinator](https://warpinator.com/warpinator-download/)* | Warpinator is a recommended file transfer service for your local network. This application works with all OS options. It will need to be running on both your Steam Deck and the device you are transferring files from/to. For Windows there are two options, [Winpinator](https://winpinator.swisz.cz/) and [Warpinator](https://warpinator.com/warpinator-download/). I have personally had more luck with the actual Warpinator. Sometimes if there are connection issues it is best to manually set the network device in settings. This is the fastest and easiest to set up method for transferring files. |
| *[JDownloader](https://jdownloader.org)* | A download manager that I myself swear by. It can handle multi part links, fill captchas for you, store account info for sites you have a login with, and it usually finds the highest speed it can. Any type of DL link works here for the most part. It is recommend downloading one or two files at a time through settings so you can maximize speed. |
| *[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org)* | For downloading torrents. |
| *[AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com/en)/[RustDesk](https://rustdesk.com)* | These are Remote Desktop applications. Use this to access your desktop mode from another PC or Device that can install these apps. This is great in the absence of a keyboard and mouse, you can also send files to yourself (albeit small ones). This is really useful also if you don't wanna keep switching between monitor inputs while docked, etc. If you want real ease of use be sure to set up unattended access with a password for the remote app so you don't have to use the Deck to accept every session. |
| *[PeaZip](https://peazip.github.io)* | Application for handling compressed files. This includes .rar, .7z, .zip, etc. This is especially useful for multipart zip files (repacks/large games) as Dolphin seems to have issues with them. Open PeaZip, click Open, find where your multipart compressed files are, and select one. It should open all of the data inside the window, then click extract and make sure you extract to a place you can find easily! |

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not use BitTorrent or uTorrent as they have been known to be shady in the past.

## Mods won't load
> [!WARNING]
> If your mods won't load, it could be a few things:
> * A lot of times, mods use/alter/interact with DLL files. Try adding them to the prefix per this [section](#adding-dlls-to-proton).
> * In some instances, there is a Linux version of the mod application you're trying to use, be sure to check into the source of the mod loader.
> * Check this [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeckTricks/comments/xnmm32/game_modding_guide/) from [r/SteamDeckTricks](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeckTricks/).

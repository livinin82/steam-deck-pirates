# Cracks/DLC/Updates
> [!NOTE]
> Since a lot of cracks and updates are made for PC, it is often recommended to do whatever patching of files is required on your PC, then to transfer the fully patched game over to your Deck. This certainly applies in situations with CreamAPI, Goldberg Steam Emulator, and any cracked game updates. If you don't have the means to do that, or you like to do things in hard mode, then here is how you'd do that.
>
> This is not a blanket guide for all situations. This is just for the most common situations. Further tweaking may be needed depending on the game, the patch, or a plethora of other reasons.
> Make sure ProtonTricks has access to your drives and SD card through Flatseal.

> [!NOTE]
> Most modloaders really just modify and apply new files within the game folder. This can be done manually in most cases.
> Don't forget to add DLLs through one of the methods listed in the DLLs part of this guide.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you still have trouble and you don't own a PC, this may be the only time we recommend installing Windows on an SD card and doing the file operations there. There are not many situations where it can't be done all through the Deck.

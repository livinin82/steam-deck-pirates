## ISO Files

> [!NOTE]
> Some games (even after you extract them) will be in *ISO* format.
> These are digital disc images. In Windows, opening this would be the same thing as inserting a disc for your game to install from, except it's all digital. These will have a `.iso` extension, and will usually be rather large in size.
>
> In some cases, this functionality may be built into Dolphin's contect menu by `right-clicking>hovering over Mount/unmount iso image>clicking Mount`. If that option is not present read below.

## Switch Emulation

#### Recommended Emulators

> [!NOTE]
> As of 2024, the two main Switch emulators were taken down by the most ruthlessly litigious playing card game companies of all time. Taken down does not mean gone, though. Nothing is ever fully erased from the internet. **EVER**. With that being said, we are not going to risk having this guide taken down by linking but as of now the best and most reliable iterations are to find mirrors of **Yuzu** or **Ryujinx**. Those will have been last updated before the shutdowns. As of the time this guide was written that should not affect any of the current games that are out (at least the important ones). There is a fork of **Ryujinx** that is being maintained by *GreemDev*. The **Yuzu** forks are **Sudachi** or **Suyu**.

> [!CAUTION]
> All Switch emulators require prod.keys and firmware.
> We will not tell you where to find those.

#### Switch Emulator Performance
Some games will run perfectly fine on the Deck. Some will have occasional frame dips. Some will have bad audio. Some just won't work at all. This is the nature of emulation. The more popular games will have patches available for them. Someone has amazingly made a [compatibility list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AhKo6rjQHXLuZEHPozA-F-YPejLPBrj0jbPNUyNDx78/edit?gid=77197668#gid=77197668).
